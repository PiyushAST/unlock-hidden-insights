        *   [ ] Visualize data distributions (histograms, box plots).
        *   [ ] Identify correlations between features.
        *   [ ] Handle missing values (imputation or removal).
        *   [ ] Address outliers (transformation or removal).
    *   [ ] Feature engineering:
        *   [ ] Create new features from existing ones.
        *   [ ] Encode categorical features (one-hot encoding, label encoding).
        *   [ ] Scale numerical features (standardization, normalization).
    *   [ ] Commit changes to Git frequently with descriptive messages.
*   [ ] **Vector Embeddings (if applicable):**
    *   [ ] Choose an embedding model (e.g., Sentence Transformers, OpenAI Embeddings).
    *   [ ] Generate vector embeddings for the relevant data.
    *   [ ] Index the embeddings in the vector database.
*   [ ] **Machine Learning Model Selection and Training:**
    *   [ ] Choose appropriate machine learning model(s) based on the problem type (classification, regression, clustering).
    *   [ ] Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).
    *   [ ] Train the model(s) on the training data.
    *   [ ] Tune model hyperparameters using cross-validation or grid search.
    *   [ ] Save the trained model(s) to disk (e.g., using `pickle` or `joblib`).
    *   [ ] Commit changes to Git.
*   [ ] **Git Branching and Merging (Crucial):**
    *   [ ] Create a new branch for each significant feature or experiment.
    *   [ ] Regularly commit your code to your branch.
    *   [ ] Use `git reset`, `git revert`, and `git checkout` carefully to undo mistakes.  Understand the differences!
    *   [ ] Merge your branch back into the main branch after thorough testing and review.
*   [ ] **Integration with Vector Database (if applicable):**
    *   [ ] Implement queries to the vector database to retrieve relevant data based on similarity search.
    *   [ ] Use the retrieved data to enhance the machine learning model's performance or provide additional insights.

**III. Testing and Validation:**

*   [ ] **Model Evaluation:**
    *   [ ] Evaluate the model(s) on the testing data using appropriate metrics:
        *   [ ] Classification: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC.
        *   [ ] Regression: mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), R-squared.
        *   [ ] Clustering: silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index.
    *   [ ] Analyze the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.
*   [ ] **Vector Database Performance (if applicable):**
    *   [ ] Measure the query latency of the vector database.

*   [ ] **Model Retraining:**
    *   [ ] Periodically retrain the model with new data.
    *   [ ] Automate the retraining process.
